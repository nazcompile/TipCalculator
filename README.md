Tip Calculator iPhone Application.
First ever IOS Application using Xamarin and C# - so my code most likely doesnâ€™t look well structured, but life is a learning process! :)

How does it work -
- Enter Bill Amount using the text field.
- Select how much percentage you want to tip
- Select number of people to split the bill
- Total Tip, Total Bill (including tip), and Bill per Person (including tip) auto-updates
